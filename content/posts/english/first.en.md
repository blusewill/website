Hello Welcome to blusewill's **NEW** Website this posts is why I use the New Theme instend of the PaperMod

# Why?

Because when I am grabbing my website from GitHub and I installed the newest Hugo Version and it's decide to give me the Error so that's 
why I replace my Website to another Theme ~~(Actual reason is I didn't want to Debug the Website XD)~~

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My Website is kinda broken? <a href="https://t.co/0zw0GwPrYd">pic.twitter.com/0zw0GwPrYd</a></p>&mdash; 小品大大 aka.
