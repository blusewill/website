I bet is a long time that I haven't done a website Update

Well Let me tell you this website's difference NOW!

# We are at Cloudflare Family NOW!

If you don't know, I move this website to Cloudflare pages due to I am using netlify for my workplace website.

And the content on it is all images which takes tons of bandwidth

![The Bandwidth of my workplace website takes](/img/website-update/2023-08-24_23-03.png)

So I decided to split it one at Cloudflare and another one at netlify

So the website that you are viewing right now which is [blusewill.us.to](https://blusewill.us.to) is all hosted on Cloudflare

And we can go to the next topic

# New Domain?

For Honest I still didn't have new Domain but if you guys want you still can support me on [buymeacoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/blusewill) I guess we can buy blusewill.tech one day (or .com)

So what I actually did is I use a service called [FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org) I think that is old enough that can maintain this website to be available until one day it will be down (Let's hope that won't happen).

So Yeah I didn't actually "own" this domain, instead I just borrow from other peoples domain which I guess won't happen something bad since this domain has been available since this domain is already available since 2004 

![This Domain has been hold for 2004](/img/website-update/2023-08-24_23-23.png)

So it should be last long enough

# Wrapping Up

So This is the website Update which it takes me tons of time to setup this DNS server to make everyone easy to remember.

[blusewill.us.to](https://blusewill.us.to) should be last long enough that until us.to's owner doesn't want to do this anymore.

But hey since this still works we should be happy there is a lot of service like this can make website for Free

No matter is FreeDNS Netlify Cloudflare building a website is really becoming a easy thing these day.

So I should say is build your own website!

Because no matter what happens your website is still the thing will maintain to be on.

Ok I guess that's everything I will see you all in next article :D
