Welcome to my life update 2024.

It's Currently Nov 18th 2024

Time really flews by. Like a Wolf Running.

But I am happy to announce that this year is my favorite year so far!

I have been to Furry Convention. Or starting a new Chinese Twitch Channel

Like... I am making friends... day by day...

I have no idea like why I have the feeling like this.

It just... Fun? or should I say... abnormal?

Through out this year. I can say my name is blusewill.

And people will be happy seeing me?

This is not what I originally think of...

But... Thanks Everyone who comes out and boosting me I guess...

## Recent Projects

Recently I have been starting some new projects

Some of them is private

Some of them are public and you can use it today!

### TwitchChatTTS

[![TwitchChatTTS](https://github.com/blusewill/TwitchChatTTS/blob/master/Photo/Twitch%20Chat%20TTS%20Logo.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/blusewill/TwitchChatTTS)

So I wrote a bot to read out Twitch Chat.

I know there is a lot of existing program already available. But I still like to wrote one my self.

And if I would like to do customize everything. I could do it.

Maybe one day I will add something like special TTS?

### [ytvideo-whisper](https://github.com/blusewill/ytvideo-whisper)

Finally ytvideo-whisper is now in a stage that I **FINALLY** making a faster-whisper version

Generate faster than a minute and the ability to use custom models is what I want.

But I still have to deal with the local environment. After that ytvideo-whisper might be the solution for people who want to generate subtitles

But I still have more to overcome... Since there is only one person and one tester...

### Discord Bots

Recently I am experimenting some discord.py API.

And I was able to make a bot which is currently online and can say hello every day at 7:30

This is like. The kind of bot I want... Might be useless but fun lol

## Tough Life Situation

Though I have life like this... But I hate my in real life very seriously...

I think I might have depression after all... I should take a therapy...

But when day after day... I have no idea what to do in real life...

Everyday in the morning I was doing something boring.

But at the night I started doing something fun. Like a Wolf...

Don't listen to anyone's suggestion is one of my thing.

And will happy to announce that I was right. I have chosen the path. The way I am going.

So at the end of this article. I would like to give out an quote.

> If you want to do something. Do it till make it. No matter how hard it is. Even if you let it down it's still fun in the end - blusewill 2024
