Hi. This is blusewill.

Welcome to the long time haven't life update.

I have been through alot of things recently.

I want to share what I am learning. And What I am doing recently.

And my feelings recently.

## Jobs

Yes. I am finally not going to be a part timer.

I usually did something case by cases.

Now I think is finally a time to grow up.

I am going to check what carrer I want to work on in the future.

After that I will do the life update again I think?

If I have time.

## What am I doing Recently?

If you haven't found out.

2025 is currently the year that I didn't stream a bunch...

I usually stream a lot in the past. But now? I haven't Stream for 3 months on Wolf Channel

Though I still stream on my Twitch Channel. But I am not just feeling happy that way?

Probably is because my though is just basically.

I need to Stream. I open my PC. And open OBS. And Start Streaming.

This is like doing homework. I already like lost the feeling doing Stream.

This isn't about I am going to stop streaming. It justs I need a break.

So give me sometime.

Next I am learning about how to like chatting with others.

I am the kind of person that can't talk in front of people.

Even I tried to. I will let someone angry by accident.

So I still learning... Probably you will see me have new personallity in the future?

Recently Coding?

Nothing... though I am redesigning the ytvideo-whisper with the GUI interface.

But I think there will be No ETA. Since I am single person working on this project. 

No one else is helping me, So make sure to went to GitHub giving me a contribute I think?

Finally Last part is about recent feeling.

I am sad... Recently...

2025 is like the hardest depression of the year.

I let my friend really angry.

And I think I didn't did something smart.

I just leave the Discord Server. And Vanish from the Internet.

Sort of... I think...

I need some break. This Internet thing is so sad...

# Recent Watched

I just finished watching a Netflix Series.

It's called 八尺門的辯護人.

Like 5 minutes ago? When I am writing this article.

I started watching this like 2024. And I finally finish it.

It's about the event in Taiwan. Really Recommended if you want to know more about Taiwan.

# Recent Liked

I am been to like very hard depression this year.

So my friend recommended me using ChatGPT with the following prompt

"You're now a therapist. Now I want to you to simulate I am your patient trying to curing me."

Now I have to say. It's like the free therapist that will walk you through the process.

Even it will letting you into your little world.

Well I haven't told like anyone about my little world.

But that would be the next article I think.
