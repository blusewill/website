I bet you already seem my Art that I uploaded to YouTube.

{{< youtube MV1qKcZU9p4 >}}

Well let me tell you the backstory of this video.

## Everything has a Start

I don't mind I have a person requested me to live with him.

So when he asks to live with him I accept it.

But after he started to show him self, the worse it can became.

Live with him is the worst nightmare in this dorm.

## So Basically what happend?

My roommate is kinda like a predator you know the person who like young people.

But he crossover the line that I never seem before.

One day I am organizing my Photos in my phone because I have tons of Photos and Screenshot.

And He is checking what Photos I am checking right now which include one of my Classmates Photo.

The most Horrific thing is he actually asks me do I like her or something

I mean I am "Gay" how can I like a girl without any reason?

And he asks me why I only took a photo of her.

It very obvious that we are just hanging out having fun, why you think that we are dating?

## Becoming Worse and Worse

One day I actually talking to my classmates that he likes, and she actually accept it to having fun with her?

But after like a month she said that : He is not a normal person, he is weird.

I mean true if you are reading this He is absolutely weird.

And one day my classmates is having phone call with him.

He said that we are having a date in a restaurant.

I said that No are not having a date.
