This might be heart breaking for Ninjago Community. But Yes I am quitting Ninjago Community and Soundtrack Community. 

Due to... I didn't really like to work on the exact same thing again.


So I private every single Ninjago Soundtrack Edit I have made and decided to never look back and pass it on

Chances are you might have Downloaded a copy of my Ninjago Soundtrack Edit. I don't really care you repost it again.

But for my main focus now is going to creating Art and short Animation.

Thanks for you guys continues support since 2020!
