But now these days it’s even more hard to keep up at 1 AM I have to sleep to refresh my energy. These days my thoughtsWhat these days I think will be best for me is leaving Taiwan and moving to a country side of Iceland. In case you didn’t know. I likes cold weather. As cold as possible. And I likes to be lonely and trying to learning some survival skills makes me like wild man. And maybe I can went to some getting drunk in traven too. Now these days I am watching my Computer monitor looking at Cole and Wolf makes me happy since I am still making my dream well digitally. Todo but can’tI know I should take some therapy sessions and these days I don’t really have time anymore. Half of my time is spending on School and it’s too expensive to take some therapy sessions. Though I can use some service like better help but I think if I am upset I only want to talk to my self. Facts : I have 2 persons in my mind Me and Wolf After Creating Wolf this year my mind starting to have his sounds. This maybe because of depression that I have been encounter fora long time. Future PlansSo at the end of the year I decided to get a job. In order to let me still getting positive on something like life. Since at the end of this year I feel depressed. Unless I turn on my OBS and started streaming will keeps me stay positive most of the time. Instead me feeling upset I felt great.

We are at Cloudflare Family NOW!If you don’t know, I move this website to Cloudflare pages due to I am using netlify for my workplace website. And the content on it is all images which takes tons of bandwidth So I decided to split it one at Cloudflare and another one at netlify So the website that you are viewing right now which is blusewill.us.to is all hosted on Cloudflare And we can go to the next topic New Domain?For Honest I still didn’t have new Domain but if you guys want you still can support me on buymeacoffee I guess we can buy blusewill.tech one day (or .com) So what I actually did is I use a service called FreeDNS I think that is old enough that can maintain this website to be available until one day it will be down (Let’s hope that won’t happen). So Yeah I didn’t actually “own” this domain, instead I just borrow from other peoples domain which I guess won’t happen something bad since this domain has been available since this domain is already available since 2004 So it should be last long enough Wrapping UpSo This is the website Update which it takes me tons of time to setup this DNS server to make everyone easy to remember. blusewill.us.to should be last long enough that until us.to’s owner doesn’t want to do this anymore. But hey since this still works we should be happy there is a lot of service like this can make website for Free No matter is FreeDNS Netlify Cloudflare building a website is really becoming a easy thing these day. So I should say is build your own website! Because no matter what happens your website is still the thing will maintain to be on.
