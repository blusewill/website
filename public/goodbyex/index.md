# GoodbyeX

Recently I made a article about [X Be Gone](https://chimerical-halva-267111.netlify.app/x-be-gone/)

Which I talking about some issues they have to fix.

But Recently I found out that [GoodbyeX](https://github.com/fnleaksandinfo/GoodbyeX) is a Better alternative to X Be Gone

## Installation

Last time I talk about you have to install manually through source on X Be Gone but GoodbyeX have a Chrome Web Store Page that you just only have to click once and forgot forever

### Chrome
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goodbyex/cafaialogfdbacbbhgjohmkocpkcnfjf
### Firefox
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/goodbyex

## Why use GoodbyeX?
Last time when I am talking about some issues about X Be Gone's issues. One of them actually fixed in this Extension

They Fixed Load Screen Problem Which you won't see X when you load in Twitter.

## Same issues
1. They Haven't Fix the TweetDeck Problem of XPro and X favicon of it.
1. When you Switch Account the logo will revert back (X Be Gone also have this Problem)
1. It won't replace the X in popup window

But All of these things can be resolved in Future Update And I see GoodbyeX has more active development than X Be Gone 

So whatever which project do you like Go Ahead and Check them out!
