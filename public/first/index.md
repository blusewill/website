# Welcome to blusewill's New Website


Hello Welcome to blusewill's **NEW** Website this posts is why I use the New Theme instend of the PaperMod

# Why?

Because when I am grabbing my website from GitHub and I installed the newest Hugo Version and it's decide to give me the Error so that's 
why I replace my Website to another Theme ~~(Actual reason is I didn't want to Debug the Website XD)~~
