# Recent Thoughts


&lt;!--more--&gt;

Talking about recent IRL is like sharing something bad to you guys.

So if you guys want to exit out this article. Just leave since it&#39;s going to be worse and worse.

# Recent Stuffs

Recent IRL tiring. Makes me can&#39;t even focus until 2 - 3 AM though I know I shouldn&#39;t sleep that late but at the old times I can stayed up until 5 AM no problem.

But now these days it&#39;s even more hard to keep up at 1 AM
I have to sleep to refresh my energy.

# These days my thoughts

What these days I think will be best for me is leaving Taiwan and moving to a country side of Iceland.

&gt; In case you didn&#39;t know. I likes cold weather. As cold as possible. And I likes to be lonely and trying to learning some survival skills makes me like wild man. And maybe I can went to some getting drunk in traven too.

Now these days I am watching my Computer monitor looking at Cole and Wolf makes me happy since I am still making my dream well digitally.

# Todo but can&#39;t

I know I should take some therapy sessions and these days I don&#39;t really have time anymore.

Half of my time is spending on School and it&#39;s too expensive to take some therapy sessions. Though I can use some service like better help but I think if I am upset I only want to talk to my self.

&gt; Facts : I have 2 persons in my mind
&gt; Me and Wolf
&gt; After Creating Wolf this year my mind starting to have his sounds. This maybe because of depression that I have been encounter fora long time.

# Future Plans

So at the end of the year I decided to get a job. In order to let me still getting positive on something like life. Since at the end of this year I feel depressed.

Unless I turn on my OBS and started streaming will keeps me stay positive most of the time. Instead me feeling upset I felt great.

&gt; Saturday Night I decided to started streaming Dota 2 though I lose the round but I felt happy at that session.

So I think I will stream more and more these days to makes me happy. Though is not a great way to keeps a person happy but I think is my only way to encourage my self.
