  <description><![CDATA[<p>Talking about recent IRL is like sharing something bad to you guys.</p>
<p>So if you guys want to exit out this article. Just leave since it&rsquo;s going to be worse and worse.</p>
<h1 id="recent-stuffs" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#recent-stuffs" class="heading-mark"></a>Recent Stuffs</h1><p>Recent IRL tiring. Makes me can&rsquo;t even focus until 2 - 3 AM though I know I shouldn&rsquo;t sleep that late but at the old times I can stayed up until 5 AM no problem.</p>
<p>But now these days it&rsquo;s even more hard to keep up at 1 AM
I have to sleep to refresh my energy.</p>
<h1 id="these-days-my-thoughts" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#these-days-my-thoughts" class="heading-mark"></a>These days my thoughts</h1><p>What these days I think will be best for me is leaving Taiwan and moving to a country side of Iceland.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In case you didn&rsquo;t know. I likes cold weather. As cold as possible. And I likes to be lonely and trying to learning some survival skills makes me like wild man. And maybe I can went to some getting drunk in traven too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now these days I am watching my Computer monitor looking at Cole and Wolf makes me happy since I am still making my dream well digitally.</p>
<h1 id="todo-but-cant" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#todo-but-cant" class="heading-mark"></a>Todo but can&rsquo;t</h1><p>I know I should take some therapy sessions and these days I don&rsquo;t really have time anymore.</p>
<p>Half of my time is spending on School and it&rsquo;s too expensive to take some therapy sessions. Though I can use some service like better help but I think if I am upset I only want to talk to my self.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facts : I have 2 persons in my mind
Me and Wolf
After Creating Wolf this year my mind starting to have his sounds. This maybe because of depression that I have been encounter fora long time.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="future-plans" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#future-plans" class="heading-mark"></a>Future Plans</h1><p>So at the end of the year I decided to get a job. In order to let me still getting positive on something like life. Since at the end of this year I feel depressed.</p>
<p>Unless I turn on my OBS and started streaming will keeps me stay positive most of the time. Instead me feeling upset I felt great.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Saturday Night I decided to started streaming Dota 2 though I lose the round but I felt happy at that session.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I think I will stream more and more these days to makes me happy. Though is not a great way to keeps a person happy but I think is my only way to encourage my self.</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="so-this-is-a-website-only-topic" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#so-this-is-a-website-only-topic" class="heading-mark"></a>So this is a Website Only topic</h1><p>I am not going to make a video about this but yes what you are going to look is true</p>
<p>There is no fun in Taiwan if you lived here for a long time here you will find everything is messed up</p>
<p>The government and the police everything is messed up</p>
<p>And the First Disclaimer I have to made is this only in my opinion</p>
<p>If you think Taiwan is a lovely country actually nothing is wrong about it.</p>
<p>Well than you can have your own opinion you don&rsquo;t have to accept it</p>
<h2 id="gansters-problem" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#gansters-problem" class="heading-mark"></a>Ganster&rsquo;s Problem</h2><p>Well If I talk about this problem someone will be like &ldquo;blusewill there is Ganster in every places not only Taiwan&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Hear me out in Taiwan there is like Ganster Everywhere <strong>EVEN POLICE</strong> what I have remembered like a YouTuber which I will watch when I have Freetime got a law suit that is <strong>FALSE</strong></p>
<p>Luckly He is a large YouTuber and having tons of Support in his fan base but Just use your Brain Why this is still a thing? Getting a False Lawsuit in a Country like this.</p>
<h2 id="media-sucks" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#media-sucks" class="heading-mark"></a>Media Sucks</h2><p>When I talk about Media is not about like YouTuber well maybe some of the YouTubers is going to be what am I going to talking about</p>
<p>In Taiwan if you are famous enough you will Get doxx alot</p>
<p>They will have the Agent that Follows you and film it and BOOM tomorrow there will be some media writing the False News</p>
<p>Like there is a News article that a person is smoking beside his brother but that cigarette is actually a spoon</p>
<p>You can see these kind of these news article whole day and another one is almost 90% of the News is about government or sad news</p>
<p>There will be like Car Accident every single day which you will think what wrong is about Taiwan&rsquo;s Road.</p>
<p>There is No Happy News it&rsquo;s all sad that makes you want to turn off in like 10 seconds</p>
<h2 id="education-is-outdated" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#education-is-outdated" class="heading-mark"></a>Education is Outdated</h2><p>Well please think Taiwan&rsquo;s Education is 1=1 as China but better</p>
<p>I bet who want to study boring class for like 50 minutes and the break time is only 10 minutes</p>
<p>And you have to wake up at 7:00AM which is also a bad time since the time I am writing this article is 1:39AM because I am a Night Wolf :D</p>
<p>Put Joke to a side. This time most of the students not even full awake yet I bet the normal time that students went to sleep is 12:30AM I guess?</p>
<p>They Probably not playing Video Games, they are maybe doing their homework.</p>
<p>I finished my homework at like 3AM in the morning and I have to wake up at 7AM</p>
<p>How can I Getting <strong>any sleep</strong> it&rsquo;s impossible and there will be like more when there is a holiday which I will just put it off and do whatever I want to do because I think what am I doing is more fun than math anyway</p>
<p>Like writing these article and making video or Stream is more fun!</p>
<h1 id="wrapping-up" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#wrapping-up" class="heading-mark"></a>Wrapping Up</h1><p>Ok I think I am just going to wrap it up here since there is so much I can talk about it</p>
<p>Also don&rsquo;t forget this is only my personal opinion doesn&rsquo;t mean your own opinion which I think I am just over too aggressive</p>
<p>And I think I will Update this Article when I have time to see something wrong about this Country so bookmark this and maybe it will be Update one day</p>
<p>Ok that&rsquo;s All blusewill out.</p>

  <title>Website Update</title>
  <link>http://localhost:1313/website-update/</link>
  <pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 22:58:19 &#43;0800</pubDate>
  <author>Author</author>
  <guid>http://localhost:1313/website-update/</guid>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>I bet is a long time that I haven&rsquo;t done a website Update</p>
<p>Well Let me tell you this website&rsquo;s difference NOW!</p>
<h1 id="we-are-at-cloudflare-family-now" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#we-are-at-cloudflare-family-now" class="heading-mark"></a>We are at Cloudflare Family NOW!</h1><p>If you don&rsquo;t know, I move this website to Cloudflare pages due to I am using netlify for my workplace website.</p>
<p>And the content on it is all images which takes tons of bandwidth</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/website-update/2023-08-24_23-03.png" alt="The Bandwidth of my workplace website takes" srcset="/img/website-update/2023-08-24_23-03.png?size=small, /img/website-update/2023-08-24_23-03.png?size=medium 1.5x, /img/website-update/2023-08-24_23-03.png?size=large 2x" data-title="The Bandwidth of my workplace website takes" style="background: url(/images/loading.min.svg) no-repeat center;" onload="this.title=this.dataset.title;for(const i of ['style', 'data-title','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(i);}this.dataset.lazyloaded='';" onerror="this.title=this.dataset.title;for(const i of ['style', 'data-title','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(i);}"/></p>
<p>So I decided to split it one at Cloudflare and another one at netlify</p>
<p>So the website that you are viewing right now which is <a href="https://blusewill.us.to"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">blusewill.us.to</a> is all hosted on Cloudflare</p>
<p>And we can go to the next topic</p>
<h1 id="new-domain" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#new-domain" class="heading-mark"></a>New Domain?</h1><p>For Honest I still didn&rsquo;t have new Domain but if you guys want you still can support me on <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/blusewill"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">buymeacoffee</a> I guess we can buy blusewill.tech one day (or .com)</p>
<p>So what I actually did is I use a service called <a href="https://freedns.afraid.org"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">FreeDNS</a> I think that is old enough that can maintain this website to be available until one day it will be down (Let&rsquo;s hope that won&rsquo;t happen).</p>
<p>So Yeah I didn&rsquo;t actually &ldquo;own&rdquo; this domain, instead I just borrow from other peoples domain which I guess won&rsquo;t happen something bad since this domain has been available since this domain is already available since 2004</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/website-update/2023-08-24_23-23.png" alt="This Domain has been hold for 2004" srcset="/img/website-update/2023-08-24_23-23.png?size=small, /img/website-update/2023-08-24_23-23.png?size=medium 1.5x, /img/website-update/2023-08-24_23-23.png?size=large 2x" data-title="This Domain has been hold for 2004" style="background: url(/images/loading.min.svg) no-repeat center;" onload="this.title=this.dataset.title;for(const i of ['style', 'data-title','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(i);}this.dataset.lazyloaded='';" onerror="this.title=this.dataset.title;for(const i of ['style', 'data-title','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(i);}"/></p>
<p>So it should be last long enough</p>
<h1 id="wrapping-up" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#wrapping-up" class="heading-mark"></a>Wrapping Up</h1><p>So This is the website Update which it takes me tons of time to setup this DNS server to make everyone easy to remember.</p>
<p><a href="https://blusewill.us.to"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">blusewill.us.to</a> should be last long enough that until us.to&rsquo;s owner doesn&rsquo;t want to do this anymore.</p>
<p>But hey since this still works we should be happy there is a lot of service like this can make website for Free</p>
<p>No matter is FreeDNS Netlify Cloudflare building a website is really becoming a easy thing these day.</p>
<p>So I should say is build your own website!</p>
<p>Because no matter what happens your website is still the thing will maintain to be on.</p>
<p>Ok I guess that&rsquo;s everything I will see you all in next article :D</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently I made a article about <a href="https://chimerical-halva-267111.netlify.app/x-be-gone/"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">X Be Gone</a></p>
<p>Which I talking about some issues they have to fix.</p>
<p>But Recently I found out that <a href="https://github.com/fnleaksandinfo/GoodbyeX"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">GoodbyeX</a> is a Better alternative to X Be Gone</p>
<h2 id="installation" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#installation" class="heading-mark"></a>Installation</h2><p>Last time I talk about you have to install manually through source on X Be Gone but GoodbyeX have a Chrome Web Store Page that you just only have to click once and forgot forever</p>
<h3 id="chrome" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#chrome" class="heading-mark"></a>Chrome</h3><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goodbyex/cafaialogfdbacbbhgjohmkocpkcnfjf"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goodbyex/cafaialogfdbacbbhgjohmkocpkcnfjf</a></p>
<h3 id="firefox" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#firefox" class="heading-mark"></a>Firefox</h3><p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/goodbyex"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/goodbyex</a></p>
<h2 id="why-use-goodbyex" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#why-use-goodbyex" class="heading-mark"></a>Why use GoodbyeX?</h2><p>Last time when I am talking about some issues about X Be Gone&rsquo;s issues. One of them actually fixed in this Extension</p>
<p>They Fixed Load Screen Problem Which you won&rsquo;t see X when you load in Twitter.</p>
<h2 id="same-issues" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#same-issues" class="heading-mark"></a>Same issues</h2><ol>
<li>They Haven&rsquo;t Fix the TweetDeck Problem of XPro and X favicon of it.</li>
<li>When you Switch Account the logo will revert back (X Be Gone also have this Problem)</li>
<li>It won&rsquo;t replace the X in popup window</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.imgur.com/iAEnIK2.png" alt="popup window" srcset="https://i.imgur.com/iAEnIK2.png?size=small, https://i.imgur.com/iAEnIK2.png?size=medium 1.5x, https://i.imgur.com/iAEnIK2.png?size=large 2x" data-title="popup window" style="background: url(/images/loading.min.svg) no-repeat center;" onload="this.title=this.dataset.title;for(const i of ['style', 'data-title','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(i);}this.dataset.lazyloaded='';" onerror="this.title=this.dataset.title;for(const i of ['style', 'data-title','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(i);}"/></p>
<p>But All of these things can be resolved in Future Update And I see GoodbyeX has more active development than X Be Gone</p>
<p>So whatever which project do you like Go Ahead and Check them out!</p>

<p>First thing you want to select is your Download Method, We have 3 ways to let you download your srt file</p>
<p>You can use your favorite to Download it such as Google Drive | anonfiles | Direct Download (<strong>NOT RECOMMENDED</strong>)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/ytvideo-whisper/2023-07-20_19-01.png" alt="Download Method" srcset="/img/ytvideo-whisper/2023-07-20_19-01.png?size=small, /img/ytvideo-whisper/2023-07-20_19-01.png?size=medium 1.5x, /img/ytvideo-whisper/2023-07-20_19-01.png?size=large 2x" data-title="Download Method" style="background: url(/images/loading.min.svg) no-repeat center;" onload="this.title=this.dataset.title;for(const i of ['style', 'data-title','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(i);}this.dataset.lazyloaded='';" onerror="this.title=this.dataset.title;for(const i of ['style', 'data-title','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(i);}"/></p>
<p>And the Next thing you want to do is change the Settings</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/ytvideo-whisper/2023-07-20_19-07.png" alt="Settings" srcset="/img/ytvideo-whisper/2023-07-20_19-07.png?size=small, /img/ytvideo-whisper/2023-07-20_19-07.png?size=medium 1.5x, /img/ytvideo-whisper/2023-07-20_19-07.png?size=large 2x" data-title="Settings" style="background: url(/images/loading.min.svg) no-repeat center;" onload="this.title=this.dataset.title;for(const i of ['style', 'data-title','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(i);}this.dataset.lazyloaded='';" onerror="this.title=this.dataset.title;for(const i of ['style', 'data-title','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(i);}"/></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be panic when you see these options</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Very Easy to Understand all of these options with the easy way to explain it.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>YouTube_Video_Link</code> You Have to Put your Video Link here.</p>
<p><code>new_filename</code> The filename of the subtitle file.</p>
<p><code>language</code> The language that is going to be Transcribe/Translate. If you want to Let it auto detect the Video language leave it blank.</p>
<p><code>task</code> Do you want to Translate this Video or Transcribe this Video if you want to Translate <code>language</code> is a must option.</p>
<p><code>Generate_Plain_Document</code> If will Generate a txt file along with the Subtitle File</p>
<p><code>shutdown_after_complete</code> Shutdown the Google Colab Container After finishing Generating Subtitle</p>
<p><code>model_user</code> The Model you are going to use. In my test I can use Medium in most of the time.</p>
<p><code>enable_cookies</code> This will let you grab the Private Video in YouTube. You might have to use some tool like <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">EditThisCookie</a> or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-editor/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=search"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cookie-Editor</a></p>
<p><strong>Not Recommended</strong> to use your main account to do this. If you want to keep the Video Private Best way is set to <strong>unlisted Video</strong> instead of Private Video</p>
<hr>
<p>After all of the Settings has been setup, next we are going to do is check your GPU in Google Colab is enabled or not.</p>
<p>Go to <code>Runtime</code> -&gt; <code>Change Runtime type</code> to check your GPU is enabled or not.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="content/en/img/ytvideo-whisper/2023-07-20_19-28.png" alt="Runtime Type" srcset="content/en/img/ytvideo-whisper/2023-07-20_19-28.png?size=small, content/en/img/ytvideo-whisper/2023-07-20_19-28.png?size=medium 1.5x, content/en/img/ytvideo-whisper/2023-07-20_19-28.png?size=large 2x" data-title="Runtime Type" style="background: url(/images/loading.min.svg) no-repeat center;" onload="this.title=this.dataset.title;for(const i of ['style', 'data-title','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(i);}this.dataset.lazyloaded='';" onerror="this.title=this.dataset.title;for(const i of ['style', 'data-title','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(i);}"/></p>
<p>Make sure change the GPU type to T4 to Enable it (Free Version)</p>
<p>And now click <code>Runtime</code> -&gt; <code>Run All</code> to Finish the setup</p>
<p>And After a Moment your File Should be on <code>Google Drive</code> -&gt; <code>Whisper</code> -&gt; <code>Result</code> Folder</p>
<p>If is anonfile there will a link at <code>If Google Drive Gets Disabled</code> Section</p>
<h3 id="local-version" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#local-version" class="heading-mark"></a>local Version</h3><p>First because of Windows Version of Python can&rsquo;t use GPU (Haven&rsquo;t setup a conda setup process) So at here I will demo it by using Ubuntu Server 22.04</p>
<p>First what you have to do is Clone the ytvideo-whisper Projct by typing</p>
<div class="highlight" id="id-1"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1

  <description><![CDATA[<p>So Twitter have their New logo and Name Called &ldquo;X&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The vision for X has been unfolding over the last 9 months – and there’s so much more on the horizon. Today we’re taking a moment to celebrate the progress and thank our teams and all our partners. <a href="https://t.co/azXPbe8IpO">https://t.co/azXPbe8IpO</a></p>&mdash; X (@X) <a href="https://twitter.com/X/status/1686854990864764929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>In this website Article I am going to show you how can you change it from &ldquo;X&rdquo; to Twitter</p>
<h2 id="installation" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#installation" class="heading-mark"></a>Installation</h2><p>Here is the installation of the extension</p>
<h3 id="firefox" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#firefox" class="heading-mark"></a>Firefox</h3><p>Firefox User is probably the most easiest one which you have to do is go to Firefox Add-on and install this <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/x-be-gone/"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Extension</a> after the Installation go to <a href="https://twitter.com/"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">twitter</a> and you should see it switch to twitter instead of X</p>
<h3 id="chromium-based-browser" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#chromium-based-browser" class="heading-mark"></a>Chromium Based Browser</h3><p>So if you are using Chrome/Brave that is based on Chromium you have to install manually through the <a href="https://github.com/emvi/xbegone"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Source</a></p>
<p>Click on <code>&lt; &gt; Code</code> and Download zip and Extracted into a Folder</p>
<p>Now go to Extension Tab by typing <code>chrome://extensions</code> in the URL bar</p>
<p>And you will see <code>Developer Mode</code> on the Top Right Corner, Enable it.</p>
<p>Click <code>Load Unpacked</code> on the left and open the Extracted Folder</p>
<p>And you should have revert back to the original twitter instead of &ldquo;X&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="issues-about-this-extension" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#issues-about-this-extension" class="heading-mark"></a>Issues about this Extension</h2><p>Well there is still something needs to be fixed in this extension</p>
<p>like it won&rsquo;t replace the X on TweetDeck, and the loading screen will still show X</p>
<p>but is better then having it all to be X</p>
<p>Now having fun to have that Bird Back!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This page will be updated when I finish some of Resolutions in 2023</p>
<h1 id="recap-2022-resolutions" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#recap-2022-resolutions" class="heading-mark"></a>Recap 2022 Resolutions</h1><p>So I only have one Resolution in 2022, Which is</p>
<ul>
<li><i class="fa-regular fa-check-square fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i> Support WCC more</li>
</ul>
<p>and it&rsquo;s Completed YAY!</p>
<h1 id="2023-resolutions" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#2023-resolutions" class="heading-mark"></a>2023 Resolutions</h1><p>So it&rsquo;s time to Setup New Resolutions</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>And basically that&rsquo;s all of the resolutions Although I have a very low hope it can complete most of them, but wishes is wishes, it will never be possible to finish all of them, but sometimes you can&rsquo;t tell it&rsquo;s might be possible.</p>
