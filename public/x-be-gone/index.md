In this website Article I am going to show you how can you change it from &#34;X&#34; to Twitter

## Installation

Here is the installation of the extension

### Firefox
Firefox User is probably the most easiest one which you have to do is go to Firefox Add-on and install this [Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/x-be-gone/) after the Installation go to [twitter](https://twitter.com/) and you should see it switch to twitter instead of X

### Chromium Based Browser
So if you are using Chrome/Brave that is based on Chromium you have to install manually through the [Source](https://github.com/emvi/xbegone)

Click on `&lt; &gt; Code` and Download zip and Extracted into a Folder

Now go to Extension Tab by typing `chrome://extensions` in the URL bar

And you will see `Developer Mode` on the Top Right Corner, Enable it.

Click `Load Unpacked` on the left and open the Extracted Folder

And you should have revert back to the original twitter instead of &#34;X&#34;

## Issues about this Extension

Well there is still something needs to be fixed in this extension 

like it won&#39;t replace the X on TweetDeck, and the loading screen will still show X

but is better then having it all to be X

Now having fun to have that Bird Back!
