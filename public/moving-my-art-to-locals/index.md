## What can you find in my locals?

There is plenty of things I can do on Locals

Such as.

* Behind the Scenes
    - Rendering Time Lapse (Yes I have one that&#39;s recorded)
    - Making Time Lapse (I don&#39;t think I will record this every time since I still need some spaces for the Windows disk)
* Wallpaper Download
    - 4K/8K Exclusive Wallpaper
    - Alternative Shot of the art
* Early Access to the art
    - I will upload the animation/art immediately after I render it.

So What are you waiting for?
